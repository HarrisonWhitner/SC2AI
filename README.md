# SC2AI
A Starcraft II AI player using the <a href="https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2">python-sc2 library</a>

I was inspired to start this project after watching this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Q0TIPDB-Y">A History of AI Research in StarCraft | AI and Games</a>

I am currently using this series as a reference for ML and the python-sc2 library: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3LJ6VvpfgI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcT3tPehHdisGMc8TInNqdq">Python AI in StarCraft 2</a>
